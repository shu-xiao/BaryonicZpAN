# 4-jets categorization analysis (RECO)
This is the 4-jets categorization analysis of Z'-2HDM model varying by Z' mass. 
I apply the some loose selection on MC sample to select Higgs jets and A0 jets and observe the distribution of some variables.

The description for other analysis directories is still working. :construction_worker:
